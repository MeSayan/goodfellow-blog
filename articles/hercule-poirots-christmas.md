#### My favourite moment:
> 'Blood—so much blood—blood everywhere...An insistence on blood—fresh, wet, gleaming blood...So much blood—too much blood...
'And a second thought comes with that. This is a crime of blood—it is in blood. It is Simeon Lee's own blood that rises against him...

This book was recommended to me by a good friend of mine. It has been an absolute pleasure reading this book. I found Mr Poirot extremely sharp, observant and imaginative. Amongst the horde of fictional detectives and sleuths, Mr Poirot stands very distinctly, and in very good light. 

The setting of this novel is a family reunion at Christmas. Mr Simeon Lee, once a swashbuckling adventurer in South Africa, and later a multi-millionaire in London, has fallen prey to the devils of old-age. Being rendered an invalid doesn't suit his ways, and he still keeps with him a bag full of uncut diamonds from South Africa, to remind him of his good old days.

Mr Lee is not satisfied with any of his four sons: Alfred, Harry, George and David.
He believes that not a single one of his sons is worth is his fortune, and that he probably fathered better sons' elsewhere in the globe, even if they were born on the *wrong side of the blanket*. So Mr Lee sets up a devious plan and invites his family to a Christmas reunion at his estate, Gorston Hall.

Alfred who is the eldest son of Simeon is a very devoted to his father. He is married to Lydia and lives with his father at Gorston Hall. Alfred is a slave to every whim of his father. This has the effect that Alfred's submissive nature only spites Mr Lee. Lydia, however, is a cool-headed woman, and she sees the danger in Alfred being too meek to stand upto his father.

Harry Lee is the second son of Simeon. Harry Lee resembles his father the most--in his mannerisms, his recklessness. However, Harry has been hardly anything other than the prodigal son from the Bible. He took off to see the world and has been wiring his father on regular occasions to meet his expenses. Suffice it to say Mr Lee is not very pleased with Harry either.

George Lee has earned himself quite a reputation. He is a member of the British Parliament. However, he is not without faults either. George is a miser, while his wide Magdalene is a spend-thrift. In spite of being money-minded and selfish, George relies heavily on the monthly allowance from the estate. Magdalene, however, has clearly married George for his money, and to escape from her past. She is the kind of girl who uses her looks to her advantage.

David and his wife Hilda are perhaps the only honourable members of the lot. David is the youngest son, was quite close to his mother. He resents his father for mistreating his mother, and for being unfaithful to her. David cut off his ties to his father completely when their mother died. David is a sensitive and artistic person. He has never gotten over his mother's death. Fortunately, his wife Hilda is a comforting matronly woman. Hilda helps David cope with his repressed grief. When the couple receives the invitation to Christmas it his Hilda who convinces David to go and reconcile with his father. 

Aside from four sons, Mr Lee also had a daughter named Jeniffer. Jeniffer married a Spaniard and went off to Spain. She is survived by her daughter Miss Pilar Estravodoss. Pilar being an orphan after her mother's date and his only grandchild, Mr Lee invites her to spend time with them and come back to the Lee's.

Amidst these family members, there also the dashing Mr Setphen Farr. Mr Farr is a son to an old accomplice of Mr Lee, and the latter is only too happy to accept him when Mr Farr shows up at their estate. However Mr Farr has ulterior motives, and he is clearly too enamoured by young Miss Pilar.

As expected the family reunion is not a happy one. Mr Lee sets up machinations to please himself, at the cost of hurting the sentiments of others. However, he doesn't live to see his plans come to success. On the night of 23rd December, he is found killed in his study.

Superintendent Sugden who happens to be present at the scene of the crime is assigned to the case. Sugden is a methodical investigator. He is also equally competent and is an aid to Mr Poirot, who happened to be spending Christmas with the local head of police. 

It is a delight to see the two detectives at work. Their methods are entirely too different. While Mr Poirot is always quick to admit new facts and fallacies in their understanding of the case, Sugden believes that a few details can be easily omitted. Sugden is convinced that the murder was committed a family member, and possibly a woman. Mr Poirot, however, is not willing to generalise the crime. He keeps emphasising on the *character of the victim*.

> 'We must come back, as I said before, to the character of Simeon Lee himself..'

The mystery surrounding Mr Lee's death is deeply layered. All the family members heard the crime being committed. They were quick to reach the scene, however, the door to Mr Lee's study was found locked from the ***inside***. The murderer must have exited the scene quickly, and without coming into the notice of others. But how? There were no plausible exits from the room, excluding the door. 

So which detective is right? What secrets are hidden in Simeon Lee's character? To find the answer to these questions, you would need to read the book.

The investigation that ensues is thoroughly interesting. If you like reading Crime Fiction, with layered plots, fallible characters, and most importantly an endearing detective, then this book is definitely for you.
