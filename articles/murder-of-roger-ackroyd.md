# The Murder Of Roger Ackroyd

The Murder of Roger Ackroyd is a Hercule Poirot mystery by Agatha Christie. It was initially published in June 1926. The book received widespread positive reviews, and many critics regard the book as Christie’s best work.  

This is the second Hercule Poirot novel I read, and the impressions of the first have been strengthened duly. Poirot is the quintessential gentleman – polite and well mannered. His strength lies in a deep understanding of human psychology, and in an appreciation for the method of crime.  

Mrs Ferrars, a wealthy widow in the county has recently committed suicide. It is rumoured that she had poisoned her husband a year earlier, and was being blackmailed for it. Roger Ackroyd and Mrs Ferrars were engaged to marry, and after her death, Roger takes our narrator, Dr Shepherd into his confidence.  

While the two are discussing the case, Roger receives a letter in the post, from the late Mrs Ferrars. The letter contained the identity of the blackmailer and implored Roger to see that the later doesn’t go unpunished.  Roger decides that he would read the letter the next day. The letter was brought in at twenty minutes to nine.Sensing rogers reluctance to part with information, Shepherd takes his leave at about ten minutes to nine.  

While returning from Ackroyd residence, Shepard is confronted by a stranger who asks for directions to Fernly Park. Shepherd fails to identify the stranger and returns home.  At about 10 pm Shepherd receives from the family butler Parker, stating that Roger has been found murdered.  

However, when Shepherd arrives at Fernly Park he is surprised to find that Parker had made no such call. Along with Parker Shepherd breaks open the door to Roger's study, and the latter is found dead with a dagger in his back.  

The police are called in. All evidence suggests that Ralph, Roger’s stepson, is the killer. However, Flora Ackroyd, Ralph's fiancée and Roger's niece, refuses to believe this. She employs Poirot to investigate. Poirot takes up the case, because he wishes to know the truth—the entirety of it, no matter how painful it may be for others.  


> “Money, it means much to me and always has done. No, if I go into this, you must understand one thing clearly. I shall go the through with it to the end”. 


Poirot has retired from work and moved to the village of Kings Abbot to spend his days. His identity is kept anonymous with the help of his friend Mr Ackroyd. This has the effect that his neighbours are completely unaware of his identity.  Shepherd, in particular, believes Poirot to be a hairdresser by profession. 

The investigation does reveal that Ralph had both the motive and means to commit murder. He was in financial trouble and his stepfather had refused to help. His boot prints were even found on the window the murdered has used to escape from. Coupled with Ralph's refusal to show himself during the investigation, the police are all but sure of his guilt. Even Poirot believes the same. However, he also comments. 

> “That is where we disagree, you and I. Three motives—it is almost too much. “  

 

What follows in the story is a routine Poirot investigation. The guilt of crime swings from one character to another. Besides from Shepherd and his sister Caroline, all characters had plausible motives for the murder.  

> “And he is not the same man he was—say a year ago. His moral fibre is blunted. He is desperate. He is fighting losing battle…” 

To find the identity of the killer, you would have to read the book. If you have a knack for gritty crime novels, or for an immodest detective, I am sure you would love the book.

## My favourite moment.  
“ My good friend”, he said gently and reproachfully, “Hercule Poirot does not run the risk of disarranging his costume without being sure of attaining his object. To do so would be ridiculous and absurd. I am never ridiculous.
